        <h4>Why it matters</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faster Time-to-Interactive (TTI):</strong> Instead of hydrating the entire application at once, Angular can hydrate components ("islands") incrementally. This makes the page interactive much faster, especially on mobile devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Prioritized Hydration:</strong> You can control the hydration strategy, e.g., hydrate components as they enter the viewport, on user interaction, or based on other triggers.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Core Web Vitals:</strong> By reducing the main thread blocking time during initial load, incremental hydration significantly improves key performance metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>How to verify (in a real SSR app)</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>The page would be served from the server as static HTML, loading instantly.</li>
          <li>Open the developer console. You would see a log for "Hydrating: WIDGET-A" as soon as the page loads, because it's visible.</li>
          <li>Scroll down. As the second widget enters the viewport, a new log "Hydrating: WIDGET-B" would appear.</li>
          <li>This proves that hydration is happening incrementally, only when needed.</li>
        </ol>
